- The idea that caught my attention was how small habits can lead to big changes. It's a powerful concept that applies to many areas of life. To make a new habit, just tack it onto something you already do.

### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- M stands for motivation, A for ability, and P for prompt. Having all three of these - M, A, and P - makes it easier to create new habits. Without all of them, building a habit becomes more difficult.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- Celebrating each time you successfully complete a habit is important. It boosts your self-esteem, keeps your motivation up, and strengthens the feeling of making progress towards your goal.

### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The idea that stood out to me the most was the concept of aiming to improve by just 1% every day. I believe this is a powerful notion applicable to various aspects of life. It emphasizes the significance of concentrating on the steps we take, rather than fixating solely on the end result.
