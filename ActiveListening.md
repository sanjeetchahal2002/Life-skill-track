## 1-What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

- Pay attention with your mind.
- Wait and hear what others say.
- Show you care to make them feel good.
- Use happy body language to show you're involved.
- Write stuff down if you need to.
- Repeat what they said to be sure you get it.

## 2-According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 

In Fisher's Reflective Listening, here's what we do: 
- We listen closely and carefully.
- We try to get how they feel.
- We repeat or say it in our own words.
- We ask open questions to keep them talking.
- We show we're interested.
- We don't judge them.

## 3-What are the obstacles in your listening process?

I sometimes find it hard to really pay attention because I'm already thinking about what I want to say or my own thoughts on the topic instead of just listening.

## 4.-What can you do to improve your listening?

I believe I can get better at listening if I practice active listening, give my full attention by getting rid of distractions, show interest, and ask questions to make sure I understand after the speaker is done talking.

## 5-When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

In everyday situations, we sometimes use a quieter communication style when we don't want to argue, share our thoughts, or make others upset. It's like staying silent to prevent conflicts.

## 6-When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

 
In our daily lives, we might use aggressive communication when we're very angry, upset, or feel threatened. This means we might raise our voice, blame others, or push our ideas strongly.

## 7-When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

In everyday life, we sometimes use passive-aggressive communication when we're sad or annoyed but don't want to say it straight out. Instead, we show it indirectly, like using sarcasm, talking about someone behind their back, or giving them the silent treatment to let them know we're frustrated.

## 8-How can you make your communication assertive?

To communicate assertively, we should:

- Confidently share our thoughts and feelings.
- Express our emotions, like happiness, sadness, or when we're upset.
- Let others know what we need or want.
- Begin with less important talks, like in low-pressure situations.
- Not wait too long to speak up about our thoughts and needs to prevent problems later on.
