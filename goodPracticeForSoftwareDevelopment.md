### Question 1
Which point(s) were new to you?
- Always communicating extensively is a new idea for me. I see myself as an introvert and tend to be more reserved in conversation.
- Consistently taking meeting minutes is a new practice for me, as I've never done it before.

### Question 2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- I believe I need to work on my tendency to overcommunicate. I can make improvements by making an effort to engage in more conversations and by being more open to others.
