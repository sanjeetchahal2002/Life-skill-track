# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### Ques1  What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can happen through words, pictures, or touching. When it's with words, people might say things they shouldn't, ask for things they shouldn't, or spread rumors. With pictures, it might involve sexual images or messages. And with touching, it could mean someone touches you when you don't want them to or makes gestures that are not okay.

### Ques 2 What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If I see or experience this kind of behavior, I will:

1. Tell someone I trust.
2. Write down what happened.
3. Help and support the person who was affected.
4. Make sure I'm okay and talk to someone if I'm upset.
